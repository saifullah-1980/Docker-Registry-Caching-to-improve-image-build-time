# Docker-Registry-Caching-to-improve-image-build-time

Building docker images takes a lot of time mostly. But with the help of Docker Layer Caching (DLC) we can do that faster. To improve build time of docker images there is a DLC mechanism known as Docker Registry Caching. I have wrote a blog on Docker Registry Caching and how it improves image build time. Do have a look at it.
